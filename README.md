# encryption-decryption

Encryption is the process of encoding a message or
information in such a way that only authorized parties
can access it. Encryption does not itself prevent
interference that need to insure that this information
is invulnerable to snoop, but denies the intelligible
content to a would-be interceptor. For digital data
exchange, an encryption scheme usually provides
a pseudo-random encryption key generated by an
algorithm. It is possible to decrypt the message
without controlling the key.
